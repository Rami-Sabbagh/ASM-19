# Implementation 02

The first attempt at implementing the ASM-19 project.

The documents are much more better than the first attempt.

And the instruction set had many improvements.

Unfortunatly the assembler and the emulator was not implemented.

## Tools used

- `markdown` to write the machine design documents.

## Project structure

- `docs`: Contains the written machine design documents.
